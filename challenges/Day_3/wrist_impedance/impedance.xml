<!--
This scene is identical to the previous one, except the actuators are 
swapped from direct torque actuation, to position-controlled actuators
where the output force is proportional to the error between the desired
and actual joint-space position (proportional control).

For more information on the actuator model used in MuJoCo see:
https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modeling.html#actuator-shortcuts
https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/latest/XMLreference.html#actuator-position

Things to note:
  - What happens when you play with shoulder's control? What if you then
    leave it at a constant value?
    
Things to try:
  - Adjust the default damping value in the joints. Try different values,
    including negative ones.
    
  - Try to reach the transparent sphere in the scene with the tip of the
    forearm. What strategy are you using, and what order do you perform
    actions? You can use multiple different approaches to get to the same
    state. This is an example of trajectory redundancy.
    
  - Adjust the stiffness parameter "kp" in the actuators.
    
  - Uncomment the velocity actuators below. What is the connection between
    damping and velocity actuation?
    
Tip: You can use the "Reload" button on the left sidebar of the simulation
scene to apply changes you saved in the currently loaded XML.
