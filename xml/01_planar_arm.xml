<!--
This is an example scene for a planar arm in the MuJoCo physics engine.
It is in the XML format, which means different elements can be hierarchically
structured. This file is parsed and converted into binary data structures used
by MuJoCo, with which at each time step it defines and solves the equations
of motion. This scene serves as a hands-on introduction of planar arm dynamics
and the MuJoCo physics engine and its built-in visualizer.

To load this model, run the python script "load_model.py". You can edit that
python script to load other models.

You can interact with the model in different ways. On the right side of the
window you'll see a dropdown labeled "Control". There you can set the torque
of the two joints. You can also apply linear forces and torques on the arm.
To do this, double-left-click the surface of the arm, then press Ctrl and
drag right-click to apply forces. To change the plane in which you are
applying forces, press Shift in addition to Ctrl. If you drag left-click
instead, then you apply torques as opposed to forces.

You can see the joint angles if you expand the dropdown on the right-hand
side of the simulator window. The values are in radians.

Below is the structure of the arm modeled. I encourage you to examine the way
it is constructed, and to play around with values, then reload the model.

Text starting with "<!-- " are comments ignored when parsing this file. I
recommend reading this file in an editor with syntax highlighting, such as
Notepad++, or VS Code (or even a browser).

Things to note:
  - Activating the controller of the shoulder changes not only the angle of
    the shoulder, but the elbow as well. Why is that? Is the reverse true?
    
  - What happens when controlling the shoulder, the joint limit is reached
    at elbow, compared to when the limit is not active?
    
Things to try:
  - Increase the mass of the forearm geom 3 fold. Observe how it effects
    the dynamics of the system controlling the shoulder. Fully flex the elbow
    
  - In the left sidebar, under Rendering>Frame you can select different options
    to visualise reference frames. In particular try out the "Body" and "World"
    options.
